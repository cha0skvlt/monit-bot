# 🛡️ Web Monitor Telegram Bot

A minimal yet production-ready bot that checks websites for uptime and SSL certificate expiration. Alerts are delivered to Telegram and all events are stored in structured JSON logs. The bot is designed to run in Docker with persistent state.

## Features

- 🌍 **Uptime Monitoring** – each site is checked every minute in parallel. If a site stays down for 5 minutes you get a notification and then hourly reminders until it recovers.
- 🔐 **SSL Certificate Lifetime** – certificates are verified daily at 06:00 UTC and on demand. Alerts are sent if any certificate expires in seven days or less.
- 📡 **Telegram Commands** – manage the monitored list directly in chat: `/status`, `/ssl`, `/list`, `/add URL`, `/remove URL` and `/help`.
- 💾 **Durable State** – URLs, status and logs are kept on disk (`sites.txt`, `status.json`, `monitor.log`). Suitable for mounting as Docker volumes.
- 📄 **Structured Logging** – events are written in JSON so they can be easily processed by Grafana Loki, ELK or other tools.
